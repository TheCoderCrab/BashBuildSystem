# You may add more verbs simply by creating more functions
# For example:
# custom_verb() {
#     echo "Custom Verb!"
# }
# And this verb would be invoked with: 'sbs custom_verb'
# If you want a function to not be a verb, then:
#     add its name to the 'NOT_VERB' array
# For example:
# not_verb_just_a_function() {
#     echo "This is not a verb"
# }
# NOT_VERB+=("not_verb_just_a_function")
# You may also override builtin verbs by creating ones with the same name
